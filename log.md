# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I started this challenge in an effort to build better habits and pursue my interests in coding. My plan going forward is to continue my research on neural networks and look into contributing to open source projects.

### Day 1: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on understanding neural networks in terms of matrices. I believe I have worked out back propagation for my RGB text predictor, more testing tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Going from the simple network used in the flower problem to the one used in the RGB text predictor was incredibly challenging, scaling further shouldn't require too much effort to figure out.
