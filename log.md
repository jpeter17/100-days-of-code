# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I started this challenge in an effort to build better habits and pursue my interests in coding. My plan going forward is to continue my research on neural networks and look into contributing to open source projects.

### Day 1: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on understanding neural networks in terms of matrices. I believe I have worked out back propagation for my RGB text predictor, more testing tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**: Going from the simple network used in the flower problem to the one used in the RGB text predictor was incredibly challenging, scaling further shouldn't require too much effort to figure out.

### Day 2: Aug 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the model for the RGB color predictor and moved on to adding information to the UI. 

**Thoughts:**: Formatting numpy matrices took some doing but wasn't too difficult to figure out. I can't tell if the network is functioning properly. Using a labeled dataset in the next project would make this more clear.
